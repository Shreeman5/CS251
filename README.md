CS251/Intermediate Programming/Java

All of the projects listed are done in Java.
These projects were done in my second semester at UNM.
Mainly, these projects cover basic concepts of Java like Exceptions, Inheritance,
CMD, Drawing in GUI, Sorting and Postfix calculation.
Project Othello was the first project where GUI and Logic was intergrated. Note that
the Professor provided the GUI and I had to fill in the logic.
Project Hexagonal Minesweeper was the first project that I did from scratch. I
integrated GUI and logic to create a playable Minesweeper game. As the title says, 
the game is played in a Hexagonal board instead of a square one.
