OTHELLO 																				by: Shreeman Gautam

GAME DETAILS

I did not make the GUI for this traditional reversi game. Instead, my professor provided me the GUI and my job was to fill in the logic. This was the first hard project in my CS career 
and it shows because there is much left to be done in this one. On retrospect, the game looks solvable with recursion but that's a topic for another day. So, what's in the game?

Please see the video to have an idea of how Othello works. Now, my code adjusts for two human players but I was not able to make a computer player. Also, let's say that we are near the 
end of the game and a certain color cannot make a move, turn does not change to the other color which can make a move. If the board is populated fully, you have to click on any piece to 
pop up the end-of-the-game message: 'Dark Wins', 'White Wins' or 'Draw'.
